The goal of a project is to use geographic data in combination with historical data of 600 NASDAQ companies, going back 50 years, to give the user the ability to select a geographic area, either by coordinates, or by states,
and then see how their portfolio develops across time. The program assumes fractional shares, as we want to be able to equally distribute our ownership across all companies we invest in. This has the benifit of making it 
easier to calculate the average rate of return, as we can simply take the average of the rate of return for all selected companies. Our feature should be available for a number of time periods.

InterFace:
-Interactive Map, with optional highlights of selected states, or circles around the coordinate locations that we have picked.a
-We need an overview of the states we have selected, and the coordinates and their radii
-We must have a way to display key performance indicators of our portfolio
