The ER diagram is made to be accurately depict the system as implemented. 
The primary contributor to the structure of the ER diagram is the fact that 
we had to allow selection of companies through multiple avenues, all through the interface.
One will notice that companies have a state and a country attribute. Using
this as a selector could be viable, however, this did not fit our vision
for the interface. These attributes could be utilized for other features however.
The 'Handler' is a simplification of the use of temporary tables which are used for queries. 
This use of temporary features allows for modularity in our python part of the program, 
making new features easier to implement, as well as important existing features from
other programs. Examples of which would be using longitude and latitude to specify 
geographical shapes, doing pattern matching, adding aditional interface options such as 
prices, and so on. In hindsight we notice that some features could have been put into the 
SQL database, however we failed to account for this early enough during development.
